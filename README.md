# Clipgame Maker

Prototype app for stitching together video clips into games.

Not maintained and unlikely to build, but still works on my phone:

The basic premise is that gestures on screen regions take you to a timestamp in another video clip (or the same video clip).

The screen region can be hand drawn:

There are also unconditional jump frames, for cutting together clips and looping.
